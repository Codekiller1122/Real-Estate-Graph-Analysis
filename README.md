# Real-Estate-Graph-Analysis

## Overview
This project applies Graph Theory to analyze real estate offices. Using NetworkX, it explores metrics such as radius, diameter, eccentricity, center, periphery, and density to evaluate office distribution, relationships, and market gaps. The analysis provides insights into the connectivity between real estate agents and available facilities.

Analyzes real estate offices using Graph Theory. Implements metrics like radius, diameter, eccentricity, and density with NetworkX to evaluate office distribution, relationships, and market gaps. Provides insights into real estate agent connectivity and facility availability.
